# AI-Powered Resume Screener - Backend

## Introduction

Welcome to the backend of **AI-Powered Resume Screener**, a robust web application designed to streamline the recruitment process by intelligently analyzing resumes.
This backend repo provides all the necessary APIs for user management, authentication, authorization, and OTP-based email verification.

This project focuses on building a **secure, scalable, and maintainable backend** using **Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB**. It is designed to integrate seamlessly with a frontend application and provides a strong foundation for implementing advanced AI features in later stages.

   - Login with email and password.
   - Passwords are securely hashed before storing in the database.
2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT-based access tokens (15 min expiry) and refresh tokens (7 days expiry).
   - Protected routes using middleware to verify tokens.
   - Token refresh endpoint to issue new access tokens when expired.
3. **Email-Based OTP Verification**
   - OTP sent to userâ€™s email during signup and password reset.
   - Pending verification stored in database until OTP is verified.
   - Secure password reset flow using OTP.
4. **Refresh Token Management**
   - Refresh tokens securely stored in user records.
   - Token rotation implemented for added security.

| POST   | `/auth/verify-otp`    | Verify OTP and create user / reset password | `{ email, otp, purpose: "signup" \| "reset", newPassword? }` | `{ success: true, accessToken?, refreshToken?, user? }` |
| POST   | `/auth/signin`        | User login                                  | `{ email, password }`                                        | `{ success: true, accessToken, refreshToken, user }`    |
